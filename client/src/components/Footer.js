        <h4>Acknowledgement of Country</h4>
        <p>
          With respect, curiosity and empathy for many of the world's oldest
          languages and cultures in the land I am now living in, I made
          'Dadirri' to acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of country
          throughout Australia, and their connections to land, sea and
          community. As a first-generation migrant living on the land belonging
          to the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation, I pay my respect to the
          Elders past, present and emerging, and extend that respect to all
          Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today.
